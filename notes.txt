Always stop by pressing the X.

Only functions are clear and pixel to begin with.

A pixel moving acros the matrix backwards and forwards.

import ledmatrix


matrix = ledmatrix.Matrix()
x = -1
y = matrix.HEIGHT // 2

while True:
    if x == -1:
        dx = 1
    elif x == matrix.WIDTH:
        dx = -1
    x += dx
    matrix.clear()
    matrix.pixel(x, y)

When we press the X, what happens to the API thread? If the API thread is set as 
a daemon thread, then it will terminate when the main thread terminates. So as long
as the pygaem event loop runs on the main thread (as it must), then pressing the
X should end all threads.

What happens when an API call is made:

This is called in the user's Python file:
matrix.pixel(x, y)

The function in the API module then puts an event on the Python event queue.
